## Design Document
### Hackathon Team Management System

---

## 1. Introduction
This design document explains the key **design decisions** made during the development of the **Hackathon Team Management System**. The goal is to ensure scalability, clarity, maintainability, and ease of use.

---

## 2. Design Goals
- Simple and intuitive user experience  
- Clear separation of responsibilities  
- Scalable architecture for multiple teams and users  
- Easy mapping to UML diagrams and SRS requirements  

---

## 3. Architectural Design

### 3.1 System Architecture
The system follows a **layered architecture**:
- **Presentation Layer:** User Interface (Web pages/forms)
- **Application Layer:** Business logic and controllers
- **Data Layer:** Database for persistent storage

**Reasoning:**  
This separation improves maintainability, testing, and future enhancements.

---

## 4. Design Decisions

### 4.1 User Role-Based Design
Users are categorized as:
- Student
- Team Leader
- Admin

**Reasoning:**  
Role-based access ensures security and clear responsibility boundaries.

---

### 4.2 Object-Oriented Design
Key entities such as `User`, `Team`, `Invitation`, and `Role` are modeled as classes.

**Reasoning:**  
Object-oriented design supports reuse, inheritance, and easier UML representation.

---

### 4.3 Inheritance Usage
- `Student`, `TeamLeader`, and `Admin` inherit from `User`

**Reasoning:**  
Avoids duplication of common attributes like login credentials and profile data.

---

### 4.4 Centralized Team Management
All team-related operations are handled through the `Team` class.

**Reasoning:**  
Ensures consistency and simplifies team-related workflows.

---

## 5. UML Design Choices

### 5.1 Use Case Diagrams
Used to capture system functionality from the user’s perspective.

### 5.2 Class Diagrams
Used to represent static structure, attributes, methods, and relationships.

### 5.3 Sequence Diagrams
Used to show interaction flow and message exchange between objects.

### 5.4 Activity Diagrams
Used to represent workflows with decision points and parallel actions.

---

## 6. Technology Considerations
- Web-based platform for easy accessibility
- UML tools (StarUML / Visual Paradigm) for modeling

---

## 7. Assumptions
- Users have basic technical knowledge
- Internet connectivity is available
- Hackathon rules define team size limits

---

## 8. Conclusion
The design decisions ensure a **structured, scalable, and maintainable system** that aligns with the project requirements and supports efficient hackathon team management.
