## Project Title
**Hackathon Team Management System**

---

## Problem Statement
In hackathons and collaborative technical events, team formation and management are often handled manually using emails, messaging apps, or spreadsheets. This leads to unclear team roles, difficulty in tracking members, lack of a proper communication structure, and inefficient coordination between team leaders and participants. These challenges reduce productivity and create confusion during time-bound hackathon events.

---

## Proposed Solution
The **Hackathon Team Management System** is a web-based platform designed to simplify team creation, member management, and coordination. The system enables team leaders to create teams, invite members, assign roles, and manage team details through a centralized interface. This approach improves organization, ensures transparency, and streamlines communication among participants.

## Target Users
- Hackathon participants  
- Team leaders and organizers  
- Students participating in technical events and competitions  

---

## Value Proposition
The system provides a structured and efficient solution for managing hackathon teams by reducing manual effort and minimizing miscommunication. It enhances collaboration, improves role clarity, and saves time, allowing participants to focus more on innovation and problem-solving rather than administrative tasks.
