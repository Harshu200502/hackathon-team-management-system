Project Title

Hackathon Team Management System

Problem Statement

In hackathons and collaborative technical events, team formation and management are often handled manually using emails, messaging apps, or spreadsheets. This leads to issues such as unclear team roles, difficulty in tracking members, lack of proper communication structure, and inefficient coordination between team leaders and participants. These challenges reduce productivity and create confusion during time-bound hackathon events.

Proposed Solution

The Hackathon Team Management System is a web-based platform designed to simplify team creation, member management, and coordination. The system allows team leaders to create teams, invite members, assign roles, and manage team details through a centralized interface. It improves organization, ensures transparency, and streamlines communication among participants.

Target Users

Hackathon participants

Team leaders and organizers

Students participating in technical events and competitions

Value Proposition

The system provides a structured and efficient way to manage hackathon teams by reducing manual effort and miscommunication. It enhances collaboration, improves role clarity, and saves time, enabling participants to focus more on innovation and problem-solving rather than administrative tasks.
